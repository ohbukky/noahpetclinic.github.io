	About us
The Noah Pet Veterinary Clinic has eight clinics across Bolton, Manchester and Wigan. We are passionate about caring for all of your pet’s needs and provide a full range of treatments and advice for your pets.

Our team
Across our eight clinics we have a team of over 60 people, all working together to deliver outstanding care. Our teams are made up of two clinical directors, veterinary surgeons, nurses, receptionists and support staff.

At Noah Veterinary Clinic we strive to provide a high level of care and strongly encourage our vets to undertake continuing professional development and further study. We have vets who have completed certificates in advanced veterinary practice – a qualification requiring 600 hours of study. Several of our vets have areas of special interest; for more information please see our meet the team page.

We have a top-class nursing team, who are available in each of the clinics supporting the veterinary team. Our nurses provide daily consultations by appointment for post-operative and pre-operative checks, flea and worm consultations and routine care, such as claw clipping, anal glands, weight management clinics and dental care. We are very proud to have training branches, allowing us to train our own student nurses.

Our facilities
Across our 10 sites we have an extensive range of equipment, including our digital X-ray and ultrasound machines, which allow us to visualise areas within the body which are difficult or impossible to assess from just a physical examination.

We also have our own in-house laboratories. We can run a comprehensive range of tests including blood tests, urinalysis and microscopy.

Affordable healthcare scheme
We are also able to offer our clients an affordable healthcare scheme, the Healthy Pet Club which offers a variety of benefits.
